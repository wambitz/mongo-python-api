> :warning: This documentation will get you started and will run the example from the root project directory, i.e. `app.py`. The numbered directories will provide small applications to run a **CRUD API** using **mongo DB** and containers, each number increment will either add, modify or refactor the code from the previous application. 

Follow this guide to run the hello world app in the root directory. This will guide on running this application natively (host) or inside containers.

1. Setup the environment to develop with `MongoDB`: [Setup MongoDB for development](./docs/MONGO.md)

2. Develop and run a `CRUD` API: [CRUD API](./docs/API.md)

3. Setup `CRUD` application environment for development with Docker containers: [Running your application with containers](./docs/DOCKER.md)

4. Test `CRUD` applications in this repository with several methods, but mostly with `Postman`: [Testing Mongo CRUD API](./docs/TESTING.md) 

5. For quick MongoDB commands cheat sheet: [MongoDB Shell (mongosh) Cheat Sheet](./docs/MONGOSH.md)

6. Running the examples [HOWTO: Run subprojects](./docs/SUBPROJECTS.md)
